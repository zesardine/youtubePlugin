## A Youtube Productivity plugin I made

This was mostly just me playing around with google chrome extensions, but I thought I'd make something useful, so here it is.

### What does it do?

Instead of simply blocking Youtube, it makes the experience really annoying. For example:
* It randomly pauses the video
* It randomly skips around the video
* It changes the video into a banner with an insult/motivational statement
* It replaces the links to other videos with a link of your choice

There's many comments in the code, so you're free to change it up however you like. The _actions.js_ file contains an array with all the links and texts that the plugin should use, so you can edit those if you want.

If you want to use this, download the repository, upzip it, go to chrome://extensions/, click on _load unpacked_ and then select the unzipped _youtubeTimer_ folder that you downloaded.
